# SDP_Verification

This project is about the TLA+ Spec of SDP architecture and algorithm written by Dong Luming.

The subdirectory  SDP_Attack_Spec  contains the specification based on the following materials:                  
(* https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/software-defined-perimeter-zero-trust-specification-v2/  *)                                           
(* http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/                                       *)


The subdirectory  SDP_Attack_New_Solution_Spec  contains the specification for the improved SDP architecture and 
algorithm which fixed the flaws related to service hidden feature.
